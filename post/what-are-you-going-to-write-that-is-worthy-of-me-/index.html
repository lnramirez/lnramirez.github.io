                    <p>What are you going to write that is worthy of me?</p>

<p><em>JJ Abrams</em></p>

<p>When I started this venture of having a blog, back in 2012, I did it with the whole purpose of polishing my coding skills and learning a couple of new ones.</p>

<p>I implemented it using:</p>

<ul>
<li>spring (data, mvc, security) for web server and backend</li>
<li>freemarker and dojo as front end</li>
<li>mongo as storage</li>
<li>gradle, built tool</li>
</ul>

<p>Of those the ones I wasn&rsquo;t using at the moment were mongo and gradle. It wasn&rsquo;t that big of a deal actually, earlier spring data supported mongo out of the box and gradle is so simple and easy that coming from maven is like a bliss.</p>

<p>Overtime I haven&rsquo;t added much to the site, I added <em>Bootstrap</em> to have a fancier CSS rendering and a couple of gimmicks, here and there. I have tried to write a little bit, but nothing closer to the expectations everyone has when they decide to have a blog.</p>

<p>But, my life changed a lot and all started that very same 2012 year. I received an email from a recruiter about a job that required java but they were into using Scala. Boy, I never heard of that language before. Since that day I devoted myself to learn the language and obviously I pursuit the job, unfortunately it didn&rsquo;t work out with the company, but I&rsquo;d always be grateful that I received that email.</p>

<p>After that, I took in coursera
* Functional Programming Principles in Scala</p>

<p>and was even more blown away  by how different the functional programming paradigm is compared to the OO one, that I cherished as the jewel of the crown.</p>

<p>Finally, I&rsquo;ve been able to work professionally using Scala and must say that&rsquo;s been the most rewarding experience. I don&rsquo;t code everyday in Scala, but when I am able to do it, it doesn&rsquo;t feel like a job to me, is one of those precious moments when you do something because you love it. And I am challenged, multiple times. I am not doing the <em>yet another form and submit page</em> but dealing with highly throughput traffic using <strong>AKKA</strong>.</p>

<p>But you don&rsquo;t come from 10 years of doing only java and see Scala and don&rsquo;t bother to look around what you&rsquo;ve been missing all these years. It cannot be only Scala.</p>

<p>So I started getting to know more about languages, paradigms and so on. I gravitated towards Clojure due to it&rsquo;s closeness and the fact that lives in the JVM and to Haskell, any functional programmer worth its salt knows that Haskell is the ultimate frontier.</p>

<p>I cannot say that I have learnt Haskell but love reading about it and it&rsquo;s still part of the challenges I have to accomplish.</p>

<p>After reading <em>Hackers and Painters</em> I was more prone to start doing something in Lisp. Clojure is a Lisp dialect that lives in the JVM but also in Javascript.</p>

<p>And now I&rsquo;m in the work of  replacing all my Javascript/DOJO dependencies with Clojurescript. Every time I write Clojure (or Scala for that matter) I feel challenged, is like the code tells me <em>make sure you write it properly, be worthy of me</em>.</p>

<p>On my next deliveries I will write how I migrated to Clojurescript. In the mean time, check github:
<a href="https://github.com/lnramirez/lnramirez/tree/clojurescript">https://github.com/lnramirez/lnramirez/tree/clojurescript</a>
specially Clojurescode: <a href="https://github.com/lnramirez/lnramirez/tree/clojurescript/src/main/cljs/bajoneando">https://github.com/lnramirez/lnramirez/tree/clojurescript/src/main/cljs/bajoneando</a>
I&rsquo;m using clojurescript, facebook-react with OM&rsquo;s help</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been able to actually deploy the app in <em>openshift</em> since I don&rsquo;t know how too hook a gradle build with a leinigen build. Maybe I will have to throw away gradle for leinigen altogether.</p>

<p>P.S. is kind of funny that this entry is a draft from 31st of January, 2015. Seems like is so hard to publish or do something on the side. It definitely requires a lot of discipline.</p>
